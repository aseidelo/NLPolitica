# NLPolitica

NLP applied for augmented democracy in Portugal's parliament activity.

We process the minutes of the *portuguese official Journal of the Republic*, which includes all the information produced and exchanged in the parliamentarian sessions, in order to:
 
 1 - analyze and make sense of massive and complex amounts of data produced in the legislative body;
 2 - extract knowledge and sentiments related to anti-corruption political discourse and legislative initiatives;
 3 - create analytics and dashboards for citizens and organizations (e.g., press/journalists investigative authorities, researchers) to track and monitor the (anti)corruption ideas, initiatives and behaviors parliamentarians and their political parties produce, initiate and/or support.
